Final Project for Computer Programming 2. An auto scrolling racing game with multiplayer functionality, obstacles, and a full game loop. Partner project with Michael Schmauderer.

The game involves competing with an opponent to see who can survive the longest while auto scrolling to the right. Enemies such as monkeys, rockets, and monsters can end the player's run. Scoring is a classic higher score wins system.
